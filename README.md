# Workforce-Insights-SQL-Employee-Data-Analysis
In this project, I used SQL to analyze employee data across countries, departments, and roles. I counted employees by gender, identified top hiring regions, calculated salary averages, highlighted long-serving employees, and measured overtime trends. The analysis provided clear insights into workforce distribution, pay equity, and efficiency.
