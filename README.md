# Workforce-Insights-SQL-Employee-Data-Analysis
In this project, I used SQL to analyze employee data across countries, departments, and roles. I counted employees by gender, identified top hiring regions, calculated salary averages, highlighted long-serving employees, and measured overtime trends. The analysis provided clear insights into workforce distribution, pay equity, and efficiency.
Overview

This project uses SQL to analyze workforce data from the employees_correct dataset. The goal was to explore employee distribution, salary patterns, years of service, and overtime hours in order to generate insights into staffing, pay equity, and efficiency across departments and countries.

Key Objectives

Employee Distribution

Counted employees by gender and highlighted the top 3 countries with the highest employee counts.

Identified workforce concentration across departments and regions.

Compensation Analysis

Calculated the average monthly salary per department.

Listed the top 10 highest-paid employees by annual salary.

Computed the average annual salary by country to compare pay scales.

Workforce Tenure

Identified employees with more than 10 years of service.

Calculated average years of service per department to highlight long-tenure groups.

Overtime Insights

Found the employee with the maximum overtime hours.

Summed total overtime hours per department to reveal workload distribution.

Summary View

Created a combined summary table showing department, country, employee count, average salary, and total overtime hours.

Tools & Techniques

SQL: Used aggregate functions, GROUP BY, window functions, and casting/cleaning text fields (REPLACE and CAST) for numeric conversions.

Data Cleaning: Converted overtime hours stored as strings with commas into proper numeric fields for accurate calculations.

Analytical Thinking: Focused not only on technical queries but also on extracting meaningful workforce insights.

Insights & Takeaways

Certain countries employ a significantly larger share of the workforce, suggesting regional concentration.

Salary analysis revealed disparities between departments and regions, offering clues to pay equity challenges.

Departments with high overtime but lower average salaries may indicate workload imbalance or efficiency issues.

Long-serving employees clustered in specific departments, pointing to potential stability and retention patterns.

Value

This project demonstrates how SQL alone can uncover workforce trends that inform strategic decisions. From compensation and distribution to efficiency and retention, structured queries turn raw HR data into actionable insights.
